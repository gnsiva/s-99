# s99 Scala 99 Problems

This is my set of the answers to [the Scala 99 Problems challenge](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/). 

Dan Luu has done most of them. He has already written the tests which is the most time laborious part. So my plan is to just to his test files and write my solutions.

[Dan Luu's tests for Lists section](https://github.com/danluu/ninety-nine-scala-problems/blob/master/src/test/scala/ListsSuite.scala)
