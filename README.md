# s99 Scala 99 Problems

Thought it could be cool to try to do this challenge. 
[This is the link](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/). 

Dan Juu has done most of them. He has already written the tests which is the most time laborious part. So my plan is to just to his test files and write my solutions.

[Dan Juu's tests for Lists section](https://github.com/danluu/ninety-nine-scala-problems/blob/master/src/test/scala/ListsSuite.scala)
